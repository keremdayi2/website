# About me

I am currently a final year undergraduate at Harvard College working towards an A.B. in Computer Science and Mathematics and an S.M. in Computer Science. Outside of work, I enjoy listening to music, playing the guitar, bass, and piano, and reading.

I was fortunate to be able to work on many research problems as an undergraduate. Currently, I am working on **rigorously understanding low-rank fine-tuning** and am advised by Prof. [Sitan Chen](https://sitanchen.com). Previously, I worked on **resilience and distributed optimization** in multi-agent systems, advised by Prof. [Stephanie Gil](https://react.seas.harvard.edu/people/stephanie-gil) and Prof. [Angelia Nedich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=86PxxsoAAAAJ&hl=en).
