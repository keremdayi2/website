# Teaching

During my time at Harvard, I got the opportunity to serve the CS and math community as a course assistant. I am grateful to have had the chance to help teach the following classes:

**CS 121: Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science**: Introductory course covering topics in theory of computation including circuits, turing machines, computability, complexity, reductions and randomized computations, taught by Boaz Barak.

**Math 25b: Introduction to Theoretical Linear Algebra and Real Analysis II**: A rigorous introduction to single and multi variable real analysis, metric space topology, and basic fourier analysis, taught by Wes Cain.

**Math 25a Introduction to Theoretical Linear Algebra and Real Analysis II**: A rigorous introduction to linear algebra based on the amazing book [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://linear.axler.net), taught by Wes Cain.

**ES 150: Introduction to Probability with Engineering Applications**: Introduction to probability class covering fundamental probability concepts and their applications to engineering problems, taught by Yue M. Lu.
